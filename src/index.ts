/**
 * cdp-wagmi-rn — a Coinbase CDP embedded smart-account wallet as a
 * bare-React-Native wagmi connector.
 *
 * The official `@wagmi/connectors` are hostile to bare RN (dynamic import,
 * `window.*` reads, EIP-6963 discovery, Metro ESM interop). This package ships
 * a hand-authored `createConnector` over the CDP capability core that works on
 * RN New Architecture, plus the Coinbase Smart Wallet ERC-1271 / ERC-6492
 * signature wrapping the account needs.
 *
 * The connector is configured entirely through `CdpWalletConfig` — it imports
 * nothing app-specific. See README for host (Metro/polyfill) requirements.
